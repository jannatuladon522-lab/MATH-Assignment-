Matrix Operations in C++

This repository contains multiple C++ programs that perform fundamental matrix operations such as:

Transpose of a matrix (rectangular & square)

Check if a matrix is symmetric

Check if a matrix is skew-symmetric

Matrix addition

Matrix subtraction

Matrix multiplication

Each task is explained clearly below.

##️⃣ Task 1: Transpose of a Rectangular Matrix
Concept

The transpose of an 
𝑟
×
𝑐
r×c matrix becomes a 
𝑐
×
𝑟
c×r matrix.
Every element swaps its row and column:

𝑇
[
𝑗
]
[
𝑖
]
=
𝐴
[
𝑖
]
[
𝑗
]
T[j][i]=A[i][j]
Steps

Input rows and columns

Take the matrix as input

Create another matrix of reversed dimensions

Swap rows with columns

Print the transposed matrix

##️⃣ Task 1B: Transpose of a Square Matrix (In-Place)
Concept
